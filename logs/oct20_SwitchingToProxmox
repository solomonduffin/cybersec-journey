Went to India for a few weeks. While I was there I kept doing research on different things. One thing I realized is that for what I want to do with this lab I need Proxmox, or some other hypervisor. They're more flexible in every way, and good practice for lots of difficult/useful things that I'm sure will pop up. But anyway I'm glad I did what I did with Debian, even though I'm going to completely restart now. I think having the simple environment to dip my toes in was a good call, and even though I didn't do that much, I feel more confident overall in the whole process. Now, switching to a hypervisor will allow me to really have fun with different Linux distros, and have even more containerization between my services. It should also be good for dipping into what system admins do? Although I'm not completely sure about that.
