So I was about to switch over to Proxmox last night. I setup a monitor and connected it to my server and saw this:

Briefly, I'm unsure what these messages were. There seems to have been some error at some point that could have been a number of things. It pointed to a possible drive failure though. When I rebooted, I was completely unable to access my OS and it booted into emergency mode with no root access. So I was certain it was a failure. So I got a USB, downloaded a live ISO of Debian, and booted from there. From there I was able to see that my individual drives were fine, but I couldn't see my RAID drive anywhere. I had to go through a bunch of troubleshooting to find out that it existed in a different name, md127. So it turned out that Debian booted into emergency mode because the mounting either didn't happen automatically for some reason, or it just took too long, and Debian takes that as a critical error, which is a changeable setting. So after that I checked the health of my drives and everything was A-Okay.
